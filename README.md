# Projection Mapping
## IAAC MRAC 19-20 | Hardware 2 | Group 2

### Description

A framework for physical interaction with graphical systems running in the Processing environment, using a Kinect for input and a basic homography system to to project accurate around the user.
The goal originally involved only projection mapping onto the user as a display surface, and expanded to employ the users movement in a larger visual field.

The featured interactive system lets up to four users carve and push a wall-sized field of vectors using their hands. Each user's influence is also highlighted with a specific color.  
The initial demo placed the users between the projector/camera and the wall, although better results may be achieved with a short-thow projector between the wall and the users.  
Finally clapping will reset the field.

### Setup and Use

## Installation
The framework was tested using a Kinect 2 on Windows 10.
First install the SDK for the camera being used, and Spout if choosing to use an external homography solution.

Within Processing, the following external libraries are used:
- **Kinect v2 For Processing** or **Intel Realsense for Processing** : Reading the depth camera
- **OpenCV for Processing** : Working with the depth camera input
- **G4P** : Allows the creation of multiple windows, used for calibration
- **Spout** : Streams video between local applications, if using an external homography solution
- **Sound** : Listens to the Kinect's microphone to track claps

The attached projector should be set as an extended display

## Calibration
Running the sketch with the 'calibrate' variable set to 'true' will allow the user to adjust the quadrilateral transformation of the output on the second window. Pressing the 1-4 keys will select each vertex of the canvas, and the user can click and drag to adjust its position. Pressing 's' will save the current calibration to a file, and pressing 'l' will reload the file's calibration.
